                        When the animated focus was deactivated, 
                        the cursor location has not been visible when being on the very left.

        <h3>Release 7.30 rev 8 (April 30, 2014)</h3>
        <b>Bugfixes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
				<b>Table:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Buttons in table cells can be set to report (or not) that they are focussed when pressed, 
                        which depends on the buttons functioncode format. 
                        The check of the function code has been inaccurate with the result, that the focus was not reported by mistake 
                        in some cases. In case ABAP coding depends on this information because it has not yet adopted the new mechanism described 
                        in <a href="http://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1589993" target="_blank">SAP note 1589993</a>, 
                        the transaction could have shown erratic behavior.  
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
				<b>Tree Control:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In column tree, the column width in some cases was too small resulting in truncated text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In some situations, the scrollbars in column tree have not been setup correctly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
				<b>Calendar Control:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In special cases, the calendar control has not been displayed due to incorrect layout calculations.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Release 7.30 rev 7 (February 4, 2014)</h3>
        <b>Enhancements and New Features</b>
        <ul>
			<li>
                <b>Grid Control:</b>
                <ul>
					<li>
                        Support for spanned rows and columns has been implemented.
                    </li>
                </ul>
			</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Bugfixes</b>

        <ul>
            <li>
				<b>Applet:</b> 
                <ul>
					<li>
				
						 The applet functionality was broken after upgrading to Java 7 Update 51 because of an incompatible change 
						 in the jar file caching strategy of the Java Plug-in. The Java Plug-in has been changed to not only cache jars with 
						 a codebase reachable via the network (http-url) but also to copy jar files referenced locally (file-url) into the jar cache. 
						 As a result, the installed infrastructure of SAP GUI for Java is modified and functionality depending on a 
						 consistent installation structure such as the internal security mechanisms was broken. A workaround has been implemented.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Enhancements and New Features</b>
        <ul>
			<li>
                <b>Support for New OS Versions:</b>

                <b>OS X only:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Launching the application bundle now is possible without having Java 6 installed. 
                        Before, the Finder used to check for the availability of the Java 6 runtime, which at the end, has not been used anyway.
                        As a result of the chances, it is also technically no longer possible at all to run SAP GUI for Java 7.30 using Java 6. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The state (enable/disable) of the Undo button in the grid toolbar now is in sync with the grid's undo buffer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The precision of the calculation for column widths has been improved.

            </li>
			<li>
				<b>TextEdit Control:</b>

                        PLATIN_HOME was set to point the the bin directory of the SAP GUI for Java installation package, 
                        the executable name and path did not contain spaces and SAP GUI for Java was not running as an applet.

                larger than the communication buffer has been added.
                This solves various issues with controls, in particular
                with grid controls in edit mode when doing many
                changes.

            As a first step to support Unicode with the next major

            has been tested very carefully and modified to behave
            well in Unicode environments. However there still might
            be some undetected problems.<br>
            It is recommended to use this version in Unicode
            environments only for test purposes and report detected
            problems via OSS.<br>

        <h3>Release 6.30 (May 27, 2003)†</h3>
        <b>Enhancements and new features<br>
        </b> 

        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">New list of
            supported platforms:<br>
            </span> Support for newer versions of operating system
            has been added, while support of older versions has
            been dropped. See System Requirements for details.<br>
            Users still depending on those older versions should
            consider to upgrade their environment or use the latest
            revision of SAPGUI for the Java Enviroment 6.20.</li>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">New visual
            design:</span> a new theme called Streamline is
            supported. Availability depends on the version of the
            backend. Refer to <a href=
            "../userconf/visualsettings.htm">Visual Settings</a>
            for details.<br>
            </li>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support of JRE
            1.4.1</span> for most platforms, for details please
            refer to <a href="../sysreq/index.htm">System
            Requirements</a>. For benefits using JRE 1.4.1, see <a
            href="#Benefits">here</a>.<br>
            </li>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Undo/Redo</span>
            is supported for entryfields. For platforms where no
            platform specific menu is available, use Ctrl-Z and
            Ctrl-Shift-Z.<br>
            </li>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Locale and
            codepage handling</span> has been reworked. SAPGUI is
            now much more independent of the system locale. The
            system locale is now only needed for the Java VM's
            internal decisions (choosing font.properties
            etc.).</li>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inline
            input</span> now much better matches the input methods
            type of usage.</li>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Messages shown in
            status bar</span> also can be displayed in a modal
            dialog. This feature can be actived in the 'Options'
            panel of the 'Preferences' dialog.<br>
            </li>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">@commands:</span>
            centrally included @commands in the 'platin.ini' can
            now be locally overridden.</li>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Canceling
            transactions</span> while waiting for the backend is
            now possible using the ESC key (on Mac OS X also using
            Command-.). Availablity of this feature depends on the
            support by the kernel version of the backend.<br>
            </li>

            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multi object
            clipboard:</span> cutting information from selected
            area now is possible using Ctrl-X (on Mac OS X using
            Command-X).<br>
            </li>

            As a first step to support JRE 1.4.1 with the next
            major release of†SAPGUI for the Java Enviroment, this
            version has been tested very carefully and modified to
            be compatible with this Java version. However, given
            the functional richness of SAPGUI for the Java
            Enviroment and the variety of supported platforms,
            there still might be some undetected problems.<br>
            It is recommended to pilot this version with JRE 1.4.1
            only in small environments, where it is possible to
            quickly switch back to JRE 1.3.1 if serious problems
            are detected. Please report these problems via OSS to
            help the next major version of†SAPGUI for the Java
            Enviroment to run perfect on JRE 1.4.1.<br>

        <h3>Release 6.20 rev 2 (May 2, 2002)†</h3>

        <p><b>Enhancements and new features</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Choosing the installation directory</b> now is
            more user friendly.</li>

            In addition accented and special characters with some
            national keyboard layouts are now working, e.g. Alt-l
            for @ with german keyboard.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Unnecessary network traffic when running in
            browser :</b> If running in browser SAPGUI for the Java
            Environment was trying to download nonexisting classes
            from the web server. This has caused slowdown when the
            connection to the web server was slow (e.g. in
            WAN).</li>

                    tree instead of the column part.</li>

                    <li>In transaction CDESK, columns were not
                    painted properly when the layout was changed,

            selection in single selection mode has been fixed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Release 6.20 (March 1, 2002)†</h3>

        <p>This release introduces a completely new deployment
        infrastructure for all platforms (except MacOS) including
        web deployment and browser enabling. The standalone
        installation is quite different from the previous
        installations. Additonaly web deployment is supported.
        Please consult the page <a href=
        "../install/install.htm">Installation - Win32, OS/2, Unix
        Platforms, Mac OS X</a> to find out more about the new
        deployment procedures.</p>

        <p><b>Enhancements and new features</b></p>

        <p><b>Note:</b> The new deployment procedures are not
        available for MacOS due to the Java Runtime Environment
        restrictions. MacOS does not support Java Runtime
        Environment 1.3 which is a prerequisite for the new
        deployment approaches.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>New standalone deployment</b>†<b>for all
            platforms.</b> This results in the platform independent
            installation procedure consisting of the single Java
            Archive. No additional platform dependent installation
            routines are used anymore.</li>

            <li><b>Browser enabling for all platforms.</b> Due to
            availability of Java Runtime Environment 1.3 and Java
            Plugin 1.3 on all platforms supported by SAPGUI for the
            Java Environment, it is now possible to run SAPGUI for
            the Java Environment in web browser on all supported
            platforms.</li>

            <li><b>Web Deployment for all platforms</b> is now
            supported. It is now possible to deploy SAPGUI for the
            Java Environment from web server to frontend computers
            using web browser.</li>

            <li><b>Install-On-Demand</b> feature of web deployment
            is supported. This feature makes it possible to install
            all core components of SAPGUI for the Java Environment
            at first installation step and install other (less
            frequently used) components as required during the
            runtime of SAPGUI for the Java Environment.</li>

            <li><b>Separating SAPGUI for the Java Environment into
            components.</b> SAPGUI for the Java Environment was
            separated into components. It consists now of core
            SAPGUI classes and controls. This feature makes it
            possible to apply install-on-demand for SAPGUI
            components.</li>

            <li><b>Preferences Dialog:</b> setting the various
            preferences has been consolidated into a single
            preferences dialog.</li>

            <li>A <b>MacOS X</b> version is now available. See <a
            href="../sysreq/mac.htm">System Requirements</a> and <a
            href="../install/install.htm">Installation</a> for
            details.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Bugfixes</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Web Deployment for Win98 was failing</b> with
            the following entry in installation log file
            guiinstall.log:<br>
            "MicroLoader.isPlatformResource(): resource is intended
            for WINDOWS-&gt; is NOT current OS."</li>

            <li><b>Crash while connecting:</b> SAPGUI for the Java
            crashed on some Java 1.1.8 VMs when a connection was
            opened, closed, and opened again from the Guilogon
            window. This bug has been fixed.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Table control:</b> 

                <ul>

                    calculated incorrectly</li>

                    <li>The paint routine for tables no longer
                    smashes table elements (e.g. in transaction
                    VA01)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed bug that caused a short dump if a
                    picture URL string was given which was one or
                    two characters long.</li>

                    <li>Changed behaviour when an empty URL string
                    is given: the old picture is retained.</li>

                    <li>If the display mode had been changed and a
                    new image was loaded in the image control, the
                    old image erratically appeared again when the
                    display mode was changed again.</li>

                    PLMD_AUDIT</li>

                    <li>Fixed exception in transaction SPRO:
                    expanding empty notes caused the tree control
                    to ignore clicks.</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Release 6.10 (July 13, 2001)†</h3>

        <p>This release introduces a completely new web deployment
        infrastructure for Win32 platforms, which is quite
        different from the existing 4.6 versions. Please consult
        the document <a href="upgrade.htm">Upgrade from 4.6
        Releases on Win32</a> to find out whether this will affect
        you.</p>

        <h3>Release 4.6D rev 20 (March 19, 2001)</h3>

        <p>In contrast to previous patch releases, this release has
        seen major internal restructuring (hence the large version
        number gap). This restructuring resulted in a dramatic
        improvement of overall GUI performance. Tests have shown a
        speedup of up to 200 % for large dynpros.†</p>

        <p><b>Enhancements and new features</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Performance:</b> Overall performance has been
                dramatically improved, making the application a lot
                more responsive, particularly for large dynpros
                (containing a lot of elements). In detail: 

                <ul>
                    <li>internal redesign of property handling</li>

                    <li>cached properties are now used where ever
                    possible</li>

                    <li>new dynpro elements are now created by
                    cloning existing similar elements</li>

                    <li>layouting and drawing has been restructured
                    and improved</li>

                    <li>obsolete code has been removed</li>

                    <li>faster access to mass data (e.g. for Grid
                    control, Tree control)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Layout:</b> 

                <ul>
                    <li>SAP Logon window is now properly
                    resizable</li>

                    <li>dynpro and list layout now is more
                    consistent (e.g. line spacing, adjacent
                    containers, ...)</li>

                    <li>dynpro elements now use up less vertical
                    space, resulting in more rows being displayed
                    in a window of a given size</li>

                    <li>rows in lists now are vertically separated
                    by one pixel, improving readability of reports
                    with background colors</li>

                    <li>text with proportional font in labels is no
                    longer truncated even if the ABAP application
                    fails to reserve enough space†</li>

                    <li>elements which end at the end of a
                    subscreen are no longer truncated</li>

                    <li>scrollbars are avoided whenever possible by
                    additional sanity checks and corrections</li>

                    <li>

                            headers and line spacing have been
                            harmonized</li>

                            <li>horizontal scrollbar is not shown
                            if obsolete (fixed columns only),
                            resulting in one more row being
                            displayed</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

            including default focus (i.e. if the server does not
            explicitly focus a dynpro element).</li>

            <li><b>Subscreen size</b> was sometimes erroneously set
            to 0. This has been corrected.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Lists</b> 

                <ul>
                    <li>Java exceptions resulted in content not
                    being displayed because of invalid icon

                    the parser component regarding radiobuttons in
                    previous dynpros</li>

            <li><b>F parameter</b>: when sending and receiving a
            parameter of type F (float) in ABAP, its value was
            truncated when running with certain locales. This

        <h3>Release 4.6D rev 7 (Nov 24, 2000)</h3>

        <p><b>Bugfixes</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Size of subscreens</b> have been incorrect after
            switching the tab of a tabstrip control in some special
            cases because of a bug in the parser component. This
            caused elements in that subscreen to overlap
            others.</li>

            <li>
                <b>Html Control</b> 

                <ul>
                    <li><b>reload</b> did not work, which was
                    causing problems e.g. in "SAP Business
                    Workplace" (SBWP)</li>

                    <li>changing to another object in "Object
                    Navigator" (SE80) by keyboard has caused the
                    window to ignore further user input</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Buttons in tables</b> have sent wrong data in
            4.6D rev 6, which caused the application not to react
            accordingly.</li>

            <li><b>Tabstrip Control</b> now forces the active tab
            to be visible to avoid confusion.</li>

            <li><b>Modal dialogs</b> have been destroyed and
            recreated by mistake in some cases.</li>

            <li><b>Location and size of new windows</b> are
            modified in case to make the window completely visible
            on screen</li>

            <li><b>Controls have been invisible</b> in some special
            cases, e.g. in "Process Billing Due List" (VF04)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Release 4.6D rev 6 (Oct 30, 2000)</h3>

        <p><b>Enhancements and new features</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Performance improvements</b> 

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Overall performance</b> has been
                    improved for all platforms by using cached
                    properties and default properties. This makes
                    the application more responsive in general and
                    has particular impact for large lists
                    containing many elements.</li>

                    <li><b>New List Control</b> significantly
                    improves performance for old style lists.</li>

                    <li><b>Line handling algorithm</b> in the
                    parser has been reimplemented with less
                    overhead. This improves scroll performance for
                    containing lines.</li>

                    <li><b>Screen compare algorithm</b> in the
                    parser (used for for delta management between
                    similar screens) is much faster now.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Calendar control:</b> buttons to increase the
            range of time have been added</li>

            <li>
                <b>Html control:</b> 

                <ul>
                    <li>configuration of proxy, font and encoding
                    settings can be accessed using the context
                    menu. When running the SAPGUI for Java as an
                    applet inside a browser, the browser's proxy
                    settings are used by default.</li>

                    <li>printing is now supported and can be
                    accessed using the context menu</li>

                    <li>support for PDF files has been added (Adobe
                    Acrobat viewing bean included)</li>

                    <li>improved functionality for
                    Javascript/DHTML</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Informations about version and platform</b> are
            now included in trace files</li>

            <li><b>New windows</b> are positioned on the screen to
            be completely visible</li>

            <li><b>Win32 only: Local printing via SAPRouter</b>
            connections is now supported</li>

            <li>
                <b>Win32 only: mySAP.com Workplace integration</b>
                has been improved. 

                <ul>
                    <li>Workplace option is now reported to the
                    backend</li>

                    <li>local overriding of connection data is now
                    supported</li>

            </li>

            <li><b>Mac only:</b> The <b>"About..."</b> menu item in
            the Apple menu now is functional</li>

            <li><b>Tru64 only: GMUX and graphics</b> (starting
            external programs, file up/download, SAP application
            graphics) are now available. This includes setting up a

            trial has expired. Please obtain a new version from
            www.icesoft.no". This was an internal error (the
            version was not in fact a trial version and was never
            meant to expire) and has been fixed. See also OSS note
            337346 for further informations and instructions how to

            <li><b>Tabstrip Control</b> was in some special cases

            <li><b>Buttons no longer get the focus</b>. This was
            causing errors when using the ABAP function GETCURSOR.
            The focus is no longer affected by pressing a
