        <h3>Release 7.40 rev 4 (August 18, 2015)</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>
                <b>Localization:</b> 
                Texts in dialogs coming from the Java runtime like confirmation 
                and options dialogs are now translated the supported languages.
            </li>
			<li>
		        <b>Modal Dialogs:</b>

                    <li>
                        Sometimes the buttons in the toolbar of modal dialogs do not fit into the modal dialog 
                        with the size set by the backend. As a result buttons are cut off. 
                        Now the width of the dialog is increased to no longer truncate the toolbar content 
                        (except in those cases, where changing the dialog size would cause side effects).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The usage of a faster drawing API of Java introduced in 7.40 rev 3 has caused some artefacts 
                        in various environments depending on the OS resp. Linux distribution, graphics card and driver.
                        A workaround has been implemented without falling back to the slower performance of previous releases.

                        in DEFINE code for the control CL_GUI_TEXTEDIT resulted in displaying an empty text.

                        This has not only greatly simplified the implementation but also added the possibility to support different calendaring systems.
